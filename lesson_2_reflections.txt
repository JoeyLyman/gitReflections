git add <filename> to add stuff to the staging area (the chunk of stuff that you can then commit)

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates a .git file, which will hold all the history data, and then you can also interact with it like a git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is a special place where you can put stuff and have control over what gets committed.  It lets you stay organized and have lots of control.  The repository is like a history, and the working directory is like everything you got right now.  The staging area is the interface between whats going on and changing the working directory and what you actually want to put down in history.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
